# Camp-Content-Gen

This project builds on earlier work by Marlene Mhangami, whose original Jupyter notebook is here:<br>
https://github.com/marlenezw/langgraph-reflection-product-marketer

Her notebook was itself based on:<br>
https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-reflection/blob/main/examples/llm_as_a_judge.py

**What's different here:**

- The Python script was adapted from Marlene's notebook, with updates to fix dependency and API issues.
- The PDF document was also modified â€” blank pages were removed.
- `langgraph_reflection` library source: https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-reflection

**Extra notes:**

- Run `langgraph_reflection-product-marketer.py` in PyCharm (Python 3.11 recommended).
- Additional original scripts created for this repo: `rag_query.py`, `test_reflection.py`.
