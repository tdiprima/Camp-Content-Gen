The Python script in this repo was adapted from the notebook in her repo, with modifications to resolve dependency and API issues.

The PDF doc was also edited from the original - stripped out blank pages.

`langgraph_reflection` from: https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-reflection

Note to self: Run in PyCharm, using Python 3.11
